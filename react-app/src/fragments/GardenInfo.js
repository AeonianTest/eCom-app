            <h1>An introduction to small crop/vegetable backyard gardening</h1>
            <p>
                Starting a backyard garden is a great initiative towards building for yourself self-reliance, a Green Thumb, as well as help further a sustainable future for all of us! 
                With just a bit of commitment, everyone can grow themselves low cost, fresh and healthy produce for themselves and their community. 
                That's why the SOIL team have put together a quick primer to get you started sprouting.

                To start your backyard farm, simply begin by allocating a set amount of space to your project. 
                Record the dimensions of the ground allotted and ensure that the area will get at least 6 hours of direct sunlight on it. 
                If you don't have a backyard that qualifies, consider other options such as balconies, or raised beds.

            <p>
                Once the area has been allocated, you can begin planning what kind of crops you would like to cultivate, whether herbs, fruits, or vegetables! 
                Carefully consider your choices against the environments they thrive in, the growing position, local climate and seasons and the time you give to caring for them.
                Additionally, visualise and plan the positioning of the food crops against which they grow best with.
                Choosing the right position can make all the difference!

                Once the preparations have finished, it's time to begin the rewarding labour.
                You can purchase from any of your SOIL local establishments the necessary goods and hardware. 
                Make sure to purchase the seeds for your crops, a small spade, rake, fertiliser/compost, fencing materials and a sprinkler to begin the garden.

                Using the appropriate tools, begin your garden by tilling the topsoil in order to get it ready for plants. 
                Properly break up the soil, while removing any loose debris, rocks or weeds noticed. 
                Then plant the seeds at their recommended depths and spread. Take the starts out of their containers, put them into holes dug, before gently covering them with soil.
                Over the soil, ensure that compost is spread, and that seeds are hydrated with water.
            </p>

                From there, follow the proper care and maintenance to secure the health and safety of your garden.
                Set a regular interval of time to inspect and water the crops in your weekly routine and keep a sharp eye out for weeds or other dangers. 
                By following this guideline, you can create a rewarding experience for yourself that bring joy, beauty, and growth, while putting delicious home-grown vegetables on your plate!
